# OOP-Final-Project

This is a system for a hair salon to manage appointment bookings. This system will have features for both clients of the hair salon as well as the owner of the salon. There will be a login page for a salon owner to input a username and password. Clients will be able to input their personal information and choose what kind of appointment they would like. Clients with existing appointments will also be able to make changes to their appointments after viewing the appointment information. A salon owner will be able to keep track of schedules and profits within specific time frames, as well as make changes to the salonâ€™s hours. This system will be a terminal/console based application designed for managing the appointments of a single salon.

# FOR TESTING PURPOSES

We have a preset list of services and stylists already available at the salon.
